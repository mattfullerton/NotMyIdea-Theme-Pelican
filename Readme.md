## A pelican theme based on 'notmyidea'

This is a theme for the static site generator [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).
It's based on the theme 'notmyidea' which is [included in pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/tree/master/pelican/themes/notmyidea).

The initial commit already has the social media icons removed since their copyright is not entirely sorted out: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/2179

### Using this theme
Download the folder `notmyidea`.
Run pelican with the argument `-t /path/to/notmyidea` or put the line `THEME = '/path/to/notmyidea'` into the `pelicaconf.py` file.
